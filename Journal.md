## Journal: This is where I post all updates!

# Day 1:
~ 4.5 hrs
I made some CAD stuff in OnShape, I made the rails and the hinge with wheels, this took a while in OnShape and is pretty much the textbook definition of "harder than it looks". I also decided on my parts and full design. I had to measure and look at different screws before coming to a conclusion, I also measured my skateboard dimensions exactly and did a lot of math. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9870e610-06cf-48e0-83f9-0a7853ed46b5) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdd1107d-787a-4e14-af93-58a5deb9090d) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db342b4-5084-424b-9297-d9374f8e111f)

# Day 2:
~ 5.25 hrs
I made the entire schematic with a bunch of tweaks and stuff, I also assigned the footprints. The main issue was getting the perfect parts and doing a lot more research on the perfect footprints. I also planned how the PCB is going to look so later I can get work done really fast. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/787278e2-165d-45d3-8a2a-7146a3bcf124) I also made a lot of edits with the wiring to make sure that I could access all the sensors properly. I looked through a lot of documentation to make sure that everything was in the right place and the wires were meant to be.
