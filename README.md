# Skater5D
Skater5D is a skate assistant (for skateboards and not to be confused with roller skates) and it uses a set of 2 rails mounted onto the bottom of your skateboard that you can easily attatch and detatch to analzye your tricks! It uses 2 sensors and the microcontroller being used is the ESP32 S3 Mini-1 and it uses 2 sensors, a BMP sensor which can tell the altitude and can detect airtime, and a MPU sensor to detect movement and acceleration. The firmware is written in micropython and the schematic and PCB design is all in Kicad. The CAD software used is Onshape.

I learnt a great deal from the making of this project, but in general the key takeaways I had was to do with PCB designing and a lot of stuff related to wiring and general electronics, I had to do a lot of studying on circuits to make sure everything is wired correctly and I almost ended up short circuiting a lot of stuff.

(ps: routing is a pain)
